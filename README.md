# NotNewAtAll
It's not the first one, I'm trying again
## I don't think I am capable of aynthing.
I think I am very stupid and can't do anything.
* I didn't go to uni.
* I have a lot of debt
* I am fat and ugly.
* I can't even clean my apartment.
### I just don't do anything...
I spend all day watching [Attack On Titan](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/) or playing [Romance Club](https://romance-club.fandom.com/wiki/Romance_Club_Wiki).
**I AM JUST USELESS**
# I'm still useless, but I'm hoping to get better
It's not like I did something in particular. But I'm trying to find a second job to cover my debts. I'm also trying to lose weight. I really need to do that.
